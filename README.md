## About

A library to turn your misc JSON values into usable sql syntax. You can use this
lib for driving a no-schema data storage solution, based on SQL environments.

This project was initially thought as a service to store data from multiple IoT
devices/sources, in a plug-and-play way for each device, allowing to seamlessly
query and manipulate this data using SQL sytaxt.

## Limitations

The produced SQL syntax is only compatible with PostgreSQL for now.
